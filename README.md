**Stock Price Scraping Project Using Selenium and Pandas**
In this project, I developed a web scraping tool to gather real-time stock prices from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) website.
Utilizing Selenium, the tool navigates the website and retrieves relevant stock data, including prices, volume, and other financial metrics.
Once the data is collected, I imported it into a CSV file using Pandas for further analysis and record-keeping.
This project efficiently automates the process of tracking stock prices, providing a reliable and structured way to collect financial data for analysis or reporting.
